MPU6050 PCB Design
This repository contains the PCB design files for an MPU6050-based motion sensing module, created using Altium Designer. The design integrates the MPU6050 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope sensor with supporting components to allow easy interfacing with microcontrollers such as Arduino, STM32, or ESP32.
